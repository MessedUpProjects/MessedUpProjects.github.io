Throughout 2022/2023 I worked as a mechanical engineer in RoboTeam Twente, a student team at my uni taking part in Small Size League of Robocup.
We participated in Robocup 2023 in Bordeaux; and ended up winning the Open Source Award.
It was the best thing I did during my studies and one of the best adventures of my lifetime. 



As for what I did throughout my year, my contributions were:
- Designing storage and transport solution - crates.
- Improving solenoid drive
- Developing and implementing a chipping mechanism 
- Increasing stability of the main frame of the robots
- Maintaining and fixing the robots

>Most of the what I have done has been described on RoboTeam Wiki page: <https://wiki.roboteamtwente.nl/technical/mechanics/robot_22_23>

_This is how the storage crate looks on the inside_

_This is how all of them look like after putting on stickers (plus a lot of mess in the workshop)_
