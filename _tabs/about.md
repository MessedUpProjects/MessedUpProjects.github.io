So this page says about me...


#### Messed Up Cat
This is my maker's pseudonym. I make all sorts of stuff, from furniture to electronics, from costumes to sewing accessories. I like using all sorts of materials and techniques, which all result in projects that are sometimes messed up. 



This site is an archive of my makers projects. 
Enjoy!
