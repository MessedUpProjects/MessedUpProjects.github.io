So this page says about me...

#### Brunon 
{: data-toc-skip='' .mt-4 }
My name is Brunon Bojk√≥w, and I study robotics. Robots have fascinated me since I was a kid, and now I can be an engineer building them. 
I am also interested in the field of additive manufacturing - 3D printing. I have worked with 3D printing for over 6 years now, including building, servicing, modifying and using FDM and SLA printers.


In my spare time, I'm a maker. 

#### Messed Up Cat
This is my maker's pseudonym. I make all sorts of stuff, from furniture to electronics, from costumes to sewing accessories. I like using all sorts of materials and techniques, which all result in projects that are sometimes messed up. This site is an archive of my projects.
