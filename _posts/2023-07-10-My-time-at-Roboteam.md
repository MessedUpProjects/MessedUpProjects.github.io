Throughout 2022/2023 I was working as a mechanical engineer in RoboTeam Twente, a student team at my uni taking part in Small Size League of Robocup.
We participated in Robocup 2023 in Bordeaux, and ended up winning the Open Source Award.
It was the best thing I did during my studies, and one of the best adventures of my lifetime. 



As for what I did throughout my year, my contribution where:
- Designing storage and transport solution - crates.
- Improveing solenoid drive
- Developing and implementing chipping mechanism 
- Increasing stability of the main frame of the robots
- Maintaining and fixing the robots

Most of the what I have done has been described on RoboTeam Wiki page: <https://wiki.roboteamtwente.nl/technical/mechanics/robot_22_23>
