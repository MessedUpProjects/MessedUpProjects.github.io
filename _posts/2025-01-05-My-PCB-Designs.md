# I recently created a PCB for my friends project - digital scale for 3D printing filament. 
Mateusz created the schematic, and I made the PCB and component aligment.

### This project had reminded me of my old PCBs that I made back in 2018 when I was making guitar effects for my guitar. I even managed to find some old photos of them! They might not be the best looking, but I feel very nostalgic about them. 

The first one is a tiny guitar amplifier that was intended to fit into a pack of ciggaretes. Second was a delay guitar effect based on echo bender design that I found on makerzine website (https://makezine.com/article/technology/build-an-experimental-echo-pedal/). 
Here are some acient photos of them:

I even found a recording of the amp working!
