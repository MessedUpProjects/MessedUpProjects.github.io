Packing cubes are just fabric boxes wit zipper. Very helpfull when packing.  
Those ones where designed with cloth packing in mind(socks and rolled up t-shirts). Later on I might make few bigger ones.
I aimed, for a size of 20x20x15 cm and gave 1 cm for sewing allowence.

### BOM
- Canvas (25x150 cm should be enough for one)
- Nylon mesh (21x21 cm)
- Zipper (60 cm)
