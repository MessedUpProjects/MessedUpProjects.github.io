Packing cubes are just fabric boxes with zippers. Very helpful when packing.  
Those were designed with cloth packing in mind(socks and rolled-up t-shirts). Later on, I might make a few bigger ones.
I aimed, for a size of 20x20x15 cm and gave 1 cm for sewing allowance.

### BOM
- Canvas (25x150 cm should be enough for one)
- Nylon mesh (21x21 cm)
- Zipper (60 cm)
