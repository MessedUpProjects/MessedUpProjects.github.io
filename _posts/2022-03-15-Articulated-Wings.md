The idea of having a winged costume had been stuck in my head for years. Only when I got myself into a proper workshop I managed to construct it. 
As you can see it got quite promising:

_Begining of wing construction_

_Whole frame together_

_Spine like object to cover the main mechanism_

_Wings with foil feathers_

The mechanism could even fold and open the wings!

Unfortunately, the mechanism failed a few days before an event I meant to wear them, so I had to drop the project. <br>
One day I will go back to this project I promise.
