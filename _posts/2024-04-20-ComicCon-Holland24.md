COMIC CON!

For the Comic Con Holland 2024, I wore my full Post-Cyberpunk theme costume. The costume itself was inspired by multiple works in the cyberpunk or postapocalyptic genre. The most notable inspirations were Battle Angel Alita -  [Wings](/posts/Articulated-Wings/), Ghost in the Shell -  [Gun](/posts/Cyber-gun/), Empty Zone -  [Arm](/posts/Cyber-arm/), Lady Mechanica - [Claws](/posts/Cyber-arm/).  
Here are some photos and a video from the event:
