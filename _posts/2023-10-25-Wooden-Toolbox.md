During my exchange in Sweden I managed to get myself into Linholemns Makerspace - student run space where you can spend evenings building. 
This is where I made this toolbox to store and transport my tools. <br>
Wooden construction, with opening on the top, and a small drawer at the bottom. Heavy but practical. 

>Inspired by Adam savage's toolbox.
